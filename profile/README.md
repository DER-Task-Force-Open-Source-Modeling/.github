# DER and Open Source Data Modeling

Welcome to [DER Task Force Seattle's](https://pnwders.notion.site/PNW-DERs-Home-33d49ff437f54e12b5de8ce37bac58e9) Open Source Modeling Page 

We popularize the art and science of Distributed Energy Resource (DER) modeling using open source data tools. Projects explore technical, economic and geospatial aspects critical to the global energy transition.

## Project Scope

Projects are autonomous and have full creative license.
We do aspire to provide uniformly accessible content. This means resources and reference materials are provided and some effort is made to bring a wider audience into the specific context of the project.

This can be done in the Project landing page or in a Jupyter Notebook.

### Default Toolset
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset (hosted on Github or available externally)

## Collaboration Protocol


## Contributors

## Motivation

The full integration of Distributed Energy devices to the power system is a complex and demanding task. Bringing together DER expertise and data science is a critical part of the meeting the challenge
