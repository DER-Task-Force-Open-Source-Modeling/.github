# Welcome to DER Task Force Seattle's Open Source Modeling Page 

We seek to popularize Distributed Energy Resource (DER) modeling using open source data tools. Our project respositories explore technical, economic and geospatial aspects key to the global energy transition. 

Visit our friends at [DER Task Force](https://www.dertaskforce.com/) and learn more about our [Seattle DER Group](https://pnwders.notion.site/PNW-DERs-Home-33d49ff437f54e12b5de8ce37bac58e9).

## Project Scope

Projects are autonomous and have full creative license.
We do aspire to provide uniformly accessible content. This means resources and reference materials are provided and some effort is made to bring a wider audience into the specific context of the project.

This can be done in the Project landing page or in a Jupyter Notebook.

### Default Toolset
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset (hosted on Github or available externally)

## Collaboration Protocol


## Contributors

## Motivation

The full integration of Distributed Energy devices to the power system is a complex and demanding task. Bringing together DER expertise and data science is a critical part of the meeting the challenge
